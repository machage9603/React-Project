### Getting Started

# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

1. **Prerequisites:**

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)

2. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/connect-four-react.git
```

Replace `your-username/connect-four-react.git` with the actual URL of your repository if it's different.

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
cd connect-four-react
npm install  # or yarn install
```

4. **Start the development server:**

```bash
npm start  # or yarn start
```

This will open the game in your web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Gameplay

- Players take turns dropping discs into the board's columns.
- The discs fall down and occupy the lowest available slot in the chosen column.
- The first player to connect four discs of their color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- The game detects a draw if the board fills up without a winner.
